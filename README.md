# three-body-simulation
A user friendly way to view graphical simulations of the three-body problem.
Requires PyGame and VPython

User sets the initial conditions for each planet (position, mass, and velocity) using an intuitive graphical interface designed in PyGame.  The simulation then takes place in VPython for increased accuracy and scaling.  Can you find a stable solution, or will your planets break orbit?
